# 18 NoSQL: Social Network API

## Project Description

This is an application for a social network  where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. 
This application is made using Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM.

No seed data is provided, so it needs to create your own data using Insomnia.
